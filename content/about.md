# Project 24:00:00
---  
<br />

**smilingneuron** is introducing a new long-term project called **Project 24:00:00**.

The idea is simple:  to deeply explore how **Text-to-SQL systems** are built today, understand everything that has been tried so far, and then combine the best approaches into a practical, modern architecture.

## Why Project 24:00:00?

Text-to-SQL is one of those problems that looks solved on the surface, but breaks down quickly in real-world systems.

Over the years, people have tried:
- Rule-based systems
- Classical NLP pipelines
- Fine-tuned language models
- Prompt-only approaches
- Retrieval-augmented generation
- Schema linking techniques
- Agent-based planners

Each approach works well in isolation, but fails under different constraints.

**Project 24:00:00** exists to study all of these paths carefully, understand their strengths and limits, and then design a system that actually works in production.


## What this project will cover

Over time, this project will document:

- How text-to-SQL systems evolved
- What failed, and why
- How modern LLMs changed the problem
- Where hallucinations come from
- How schema understanding really works
- When agents help, and when they don’t
- What a production-ready architecture looks like

The goal is not just theory, but **practical guidance**.

## Why the name?
If world resets every 24 hours, only the memory will prevail. Project 24 is that memory for Text to SQL.

**24:00:00** represents a full cycle.

Time to:
- Revisit old ideas
- Question assumptions
- Build carefully
- And finally arrive at something stable

This is not a quick experiment — it’s a slow, deliberate build.

## Status

The project is currently in its exploration phase.

Writing, experiments, failures, and architectural notes will be shared as they evolve.

If you found this by accident — welcome.  
If you were looking for it — even better.
